Effective stroke prediction and diagnosis are crucial for early intervention and prevention. 
This project addresses these challenges through the creation of an innovative framework 
using AI for stroke prediction and diagnostics employing sophisticated machine learning methods. 
The research begins with comprehensive management of missing values as part of data preparation and outliers.
Utilising the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE).
The study investigates correlations between attributes, revealing significant links between marital status, work type, age, and stroke likelihood. 
Top features strongly correlated with stroke are identified through comprehensive analysis. 
The effectiveness of seven learning algorithms techniques—Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Neural Networks (MLP),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF)—are evaluated, 
with XGBoost and Random Forest achieving an impressive 96% overall accuracy.

The project pioneers an AI-powered framework for stroke prediction and diagnosis.

Data is meaningless until analytics are applied
